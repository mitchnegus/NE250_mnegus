\section*{\textsl{What Will Advanced Nuclear Power Plants Cost?} \\ \normalsize Energy Options Network (EON)}

-Study undertaken to accurately estimate costs for advanced nuclear designs\\
-Difficult to evaluate costs of adv. nuclear when companies hold proprietary info\\
-This study allowed a third party to aggregate cost estimates in a consistent format between groups\\
-Elysium, GE, Transatomic, Moltex, NuScale, Terrestrial Energy, ThorCon, X-Energy\\
-Study used Gen IV forum accounting protocols (follows DOE EEDB)\\
-Coarse categories, broken down smaller\\
-Defaults were provided, companies asked to denote deviations\\
-All participating companies had lower capital, operating, and LCOE projections than current nuclear designs (this is somewhat expected... if not, why do this?)\\
-Not all lower direct construction costs, but all saw substantial reductions in indirect services\\

-I liked the aggregated discussion, the study actually gave credibility to the companies, not just the industry\\
-I was surprised by the methodology (giving deviation from default) but thought it was a good solution; it prompts self-evaluation (non-experts can appreciate when something is 100x cheaper than the standard rather than saying our new pumps will cost \$50,000?when the going rate is \$5M)\\
-I wish they had gone into a deeper breakdown of data (i.e. distributions of predictions at a more specific level like turbine generators had a mean projected value of $x$ with a st. dev of $\sigma$)\\
