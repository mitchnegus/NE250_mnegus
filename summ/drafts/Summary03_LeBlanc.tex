\section*{\textsl{Molten salt reactors: A new beginning for an old idea} \\ \normalsize David LeBlanc}

\tab A new crop of startup companies has emerged in the past several years, for the most part developing advanced reactor designs. While their designs incorporate the latest technology and innovations in the nuclear field, some of the reactor concepts date back to the beginnings of nuclear power. Molten salt reactors (MSRs) are one such technology, originally studied by Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) in the middle of the twentieth century. David LeBlanc's article returns to ORNL's MSR designs and attempts to find new solutions to some of the more daunting challenges facing those models. In particular LeBlanc approaches the design of a similar reactor with different priorities--namely the generation of affordable and safe electricity, rather than operating on limited uranium supplies.\\
\tab While the article thoroughly explores the evolution of the Oak Ridge MSR designs, it especially emphasizes how what was termed a ``plumbing problem'' in the original design could be fixed using a straightforward geometric adjustment. Before, the Oak Ridge design incorporated two fluids, such as a layer of thorium tetrafluoride surrounding a core of uranium tetrafluoride. The layers would be separated by a graphite moderator, which could be manufactured to provide increased surface area between the two liquids. This manufactured graphite would eventually require replacement, however, and due to its complicated geometry the entire component would need to be removed. LeBlanc proposes that this expensive replacement could be avoided if the reactor core was changed from a generally spherical shape to an elongated cylinder. Then, easily manufactured geometries could still provide reasonable power outputs.\\
\tab LeBlanc goes on to explore the variety of ways that such a reactor could be implemented, finally proposing three specific models that he would like to see tested. While I found his discussion concerning the intricacies going in to each model, I do think he would make the article more effective if it was split into two separate pieces: one on the merits of the cylindrical redesign of the MSBR, and another on the models that he would like tested. As it was, the paper seemed excessively long and somewhat sporadic, jumping from how a geometric redesign would save the MSBR from its prior shortcomings and strongly advocating for a two-fluid reactor model, before then extolling the DMSR converter and its single-fluid mode of operation.

Advantages of MSRs over solid-fuel designs\\
-fluid fuel $\Rightarrow$ no meltdown (instead, drain to passively cooled containment)\\
-fission products form stable fluorides (stay w/in salt during accident) or are volatile (continuous removal already will take place)\\
-noble gases bubble out\\
-metal plates out or can be collected (metal sponges)\\
-removal of xenon eliminates dead time required in traditional shut-down\\
-large temp coeffs\\
-low pressure vessel\\
-no water/sodium (no explosions)\\
-fissile concentrations can be adjusted as needed\\
-U233/Th produces less transuranic waste (few hundred years to less than U ore levels of radiotoxicity)\\
-can process conventional nuclear waste

Oak Ridge MSBR (Molten Salt Breeder Reactor)\\
-Developed in late 1960s\\
-priority was on reducing doubling time\\
\tab - nuclear power expected to grow exponentially\\
\tab - current uranium reserves were insufficient\\
-power station designs began as sphere w/in sphere (fuel=inner;blanket=outer)\\
-became graphite separator (between fuel and blanket) made replacement of reactor components excessively costly/difficult\\
-$^{233}\text{UF}_4$ in fuel salt; $\text{ThF}_4$in blanket salt\\
-bubbling fluorine gas through fuel salt converts $\text{UF}_4$ to $\text{UF}_6$ (volatile; easily separated) $\rightarrow$ established procedure for converting $\text{UF}_6$ to $\text{UF}_4$\\
-Liquid Bismuth Reductive Extraction for removing FPs\\
-final design had outside undermoderated zone for better neutron absorption; still graphite moderated (including graphite pebbles); was single fluid\\

More recent priorities have emerged of MSR program\\
-Net power/cost\\
-Long-lived waste reduction\\
-Safety\\
-Proliferation resistance\\
-Resource utilization\\
All can be well addressed (to varying degrees) by variations on the MSR technology and fuel cycle\\

Proposals to solve two-fluid problem ("plumbing problem"--need to replace graphite reactor vessel as a whole unit)\\
-advantage of two-fluid is extraction of FPs\\
-disadvantage was small critical diameter (~1m) $\rightarrow$ small core = limited power output\\
-plumbing, allowing mixing of two fluids solved power output problem, makes graphite components excessively complicated\\
-solution is to use long cylinder (as opposed to spheres or short cylinder)\\

Designs with graphite moderator\\
-likely require multiple cylindrical core units to reach GW scale
\tab - not too problematic; graphite barriers likely will need replacement, more cores make this easier\\
-require 150-400kg/GW(e) startup fissile inventory (previous ORNL designs required 700kg/GW(e) for 2-fluid, 1500kg/GW(e) for 1-fluid; LWR requires 3000-5000kg/GW(e))\\

Designs without graphite moderator\\
-GW single cores attainable (though benefits still exist for having more cores)\\
-carrier salt serves as decent moderator\\
-simple design/small size(6.6m length $\times$ 0.7m diameter--can be fit onto tractor trailer for transport) $\rightarrow$ 224MWe reactor\\

Fuel\\
-current designs would utilize $^{233}\text{U}$; no abundant source exists\\
-could operate on HEU; public perception/proliferation concerns\\
-option to start on LEU exists if one starts on LEU but does not extract $^{233}\text{U}$\\

DMSR Converter\\
-ONRL study; single fluid, 30 yr once through, 1000MW(e), startup w/ 20\% LEU\\
-lifetime uranium utilization = 1810 tonnes (oppsoed to 6400 tonnes for LWR)\\
-many further modifications possible (i.e. pebble bed graphite mod)\\

Three suggested 200MW(e) designs\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Th-$^{233}\text{U}$ cycle\\
            two-fluid\\
            no graphite (metal tube)\\
            800 kg/GW(e) startup fissile inventory\\
            6 month FP processing cycle
            4m length $\times$ 0.85m diameter dimensions
    \item LEU+Th converter reactor\\
            single-fluid (similar to ORNL design\\
            12-15 year graphite replacement\\
            salt replacement/transuranic removal at same time)\\
            4m $\times$ 4m max dimensions\\
    \item Pebble bed moderator design\\
            undermoderated outer zone\\
            starting fissile inventory\\
            ... length $\times$ 4.4m diameter max dimensions
\end{enumerate}

***check "As a first approximation the critical diameter will be the ratio of the Buckling constants between the given geometries. Thus, for the same fuel salt and/or graphite combination, a long cylinder will have a critical diameter approximately 77\% that of a sphere. If a specific combination of fissile concentration, graphite and carrier salt gives a critical diameter of 1 m for a sphere, then a long cylinder would have critical diameter of 0.77 m."
